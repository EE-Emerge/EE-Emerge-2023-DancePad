# Dance Pad Maze Game

[Dance Pad Maze Game](https://github.com/EE-Emerge/EE-Emerge-2023-DancePad) is a game project created by a team of UC Davis [EE-Emerge](https://www.ece.ucdavis.edu/ieee/home/ee-emerge/) (EEC 105ABC) students. This project allows a user to play a game in which they must navigate a maze by using a 4-directional pressure pad controller we built ourselves.

# About the Project

Maze Game, inspired by the popular arcade game Dance Dance Revolution, or commonly abbreviated as DDR, is an interactive game that challenges the user to think on the fly and tests their cognitive capabilities. The basic premise of the game is to navigate randomized mazes with the use of four pressure pads, indicating the direction of which the user can move: forward, back, left and right. The user simply has 30 seconds to complete as many mazes as they can and can compete their skills against other friends and competitors for a spot on the record leaderboard.

# Getting Started

This repository can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/EE-Emerge/EE-Emerge-2023-DancePad/archive/master.zip), or cloned by:
```
git clone https://github.com/EE-Emerge/EE-Emerge-2023-DancePad
```

## Dependencies

#### Software
[Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) was our main program we used to run the game and algorithm.

[Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) was used to be able to facilitate communicate between our circuit and the computer.

#### Hardware & Model Creation
[Altium](https://www.altium.com/) was used for most PCB creation.  
[Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview) was used for the creation of enclosures and other mechanical files.  

## Building

PCB and enclosure files will be located in respective subdirectories. These were fabricated either with a 3D printer, a laser cutter, or table saw.

Software will have to be compiled and loaded into Visual Studio 2022 and Arduino IDE respectively.
