# Dance Pad

[Dance Pad](https://github.com/EE-Emerge/EE-Emerge-2023-DancePad) is a game project created by a team of UC Davis [EE-Emerge](https://www.ece.ucdavis.edu/ieee/home/ee-emerge/) (EEC 105ABC) students. This project allows a user to play a game in which they must navigate a maze by using a 4-directional pressure pad controller we built ourselves.

# About the Project



# Project Status



# Getting Started

This repository can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/EE-Emerge/EE-Emerge-2023-DancePad/archive/master.zip), or cloned by:
```
git clone https://github.com/EE-Emerge/EE-Emerge-2023-DancePad
```

## Dependencies

#### Software
[Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) was our main program we used to run the game and algorithm.

[Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) was used to be able to facilitate communicate between our circuit and the computer.

#### Hardware & Model Creation
[Altium](https://www.altium.com/) was used for most PCB creation.  
[Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview) was used for the creation of enclosures and other mechanical files.  

## Building

PCB and enclosure files will be located in respective subdirectories. These were fabricated either with a 3D printer, a laser cutter, or table saw.

Software will have to be compiled and loaded into Visual Studio 2022 and Arduino IDE respectively.
