# Dance Pad

[Dance Pad](https://github.com/EE-Emerge/EE-Emerge-2023-DancePad) is a game project created by a team of UC Davis [EE-Emerge](https://www.ece.ucdavis.edu/ieee/home/ee-emerge/) (EEC 105ABC) students. This project allows a user to play a game in which they must navigate a maze by using a 4-directional pressure pad controller we built ourselves.

# About the Project



# Project Status



# Getting Started

This repository can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/EE-Emerge/EE-Emerge-2023-DancePad/archive/master.zip), or cloned by:
```
git clone https://github.com/EE-Emerge/EE-Emerge-2023-DancePad
```

## Dependencies

#### Software
[Visual Studio](https://)  


[Arduino IDE](https://)  
The OpenMV IDE is used for all of the programming of the H7 Camera.

#### Hardware & Model Creation
[Altium](https://www.altium.com/) was used for most PCB creation.  
[Eagle](https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/overview) was used to make the CameraPCB.  
[Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview) was used for the creation of enclosures and other mechanical files.  
[Cura](https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura) was used as our main slicer for 3D printing. The UC Davis ESDC's Ultimaker's and personal Ender 3 Pro's were used for fabrication.  

## Building

PCB and enclosure files will be located in their respective subdirectories. These were fabricated either with a 3D printer, a laser cutter, or table saw.

Software for the instruments will have to be compiled and loaded into their respective MCU's either in the Puredata IDE or Energia.

# Acknowledgments

Thanks to Texas Instruments for sponsoring EE-Emerge, along with Sean Alling and Dr. Andre Knoesen. We would not have gotten this far without their help and support.

Huge shout out to Alessandro Verdiesen and Luuk van Kuijk with the original idea and inspiration of the [Airdrum](https://hackaday.com/2019/11/15/finally-your-air-drumming-has-an-outlet/) and the whole project.
