# Pressure Plate Maze Game

[Pressure Plate Maze Game](https://github.com/EE-Emerge/EE-Emerge-2023-DancePad) is a game project created by a team of UC Davis [EE-Emerge](https://www.ece.ucdavis.edu/ieee/home/ee-emerge/) (EEC 105ABC) students. The Maze Game, inspired by the popular arcade game Dance Dance Revolution, is an interactive game that challenges the user to think on the fly and test their cognitive capabilities. The premise of the game is to navigate through randomized mazes using four pressure pads indicating the direction the user will move: forward, back, left and right. The user simply has 30 seconds to complete as many mazes as they can, attempting to beat their friends and competitors and gain a spot on the leaderboard.

# About the Project

Pressure Plate Maze Game is a project developed during the 2022/2023 academic year by the undergraduates from EE-Emerge, a project based class at the University of California Davis, designed for students in Computer and Electrical Engineering students to utilize their engineering knowledge and collaborate with others to create a project based on a a yearly theme. In 2022/2023, the students were tasked with creating something to inspire K-12 students and get them interested in Engineering. The Maze Game is an interactive game where the user is challenged to navigate through as many mazes as they can with the use of a 4 direction pressure pad. The user can either move forward, back, left and right and has to complete as many mazes possible in the allocated 30 seconds. At the core of the Maze Gameâ€™s technology, inside the middle plate of the pressure pad housing, there are custom PCBs which the team designed and fabricated. The housing has also been designed, laser cut, built, and painted by the team. The PCBs are connected directly with each pad and have a basic function of detecting when the pad is pressed by reading the voltage from our mechanism, which will be either an open or short circuit based on the pressure applied (open when unpressed and short when pressed). The mechanism is connected through the PCBs and microcontroller, where the analog data is looped and debounced, and sent through the serial port to the computer. The randomized mazes and computer game as a whole were created in C++ and utilize minimum spanning trees to generate randomized mazes with a minimum of 3 spaces in between the users starting point and the designated end point.
