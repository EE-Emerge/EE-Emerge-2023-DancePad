# Pressure Plate Maze Game

[Pressure Plate Maze Game](https://github.com/EE-Emerge/EE-Emerge-2023-DancePad) is a game project created by a team of UC Davis [EE-Emerge](https://www.ece.ucdavis.edu/ieee/home/ee-emerge/) (EEC 105ABC) students. The Maze Game, inspired by the popular arcade game Dance Dance Revolution, or commonly abbreviated as DDR, is an interactive game that challenges the user to think on the fly and test their cognitive capabilities. The premise of the game is to navigate randomized mazes with the use of four pressure pads, indicating the direction of which the user can move: forward, back, left and right. The user simply has 30 seconds to complete as many mazes as they can and can compare their scores against other friends and competitors for a spot on the record leaderboard.

# About the Project

Maze Game is a project developed during the 2022/2023 academic year by the undergraduates from EE-Emerge, a project based class at the University of California Davis, designed to allow students to use what they’ve learned from previous engineering classes to collaborate with other engineering students to create an electrical engineering based project based on a a yearly theme. Maze Game is an interactive game where the user is challenged to navigate through as many mazes as they can with the use of a 4 direction pressure pad. The user can either move forward, back, left and right and has to complete as many mazes possible in the allocated 30 seconds. At the core of the Maze Game’s technology, our EE-Emerge team designed and fabricated custom PCBs which are implemented within the pressure pad housing, which has also been designed, laser cut, built, and painted. The PCBs are connected directly with each pad and have a basic function of detecting when the pad is pressed by reading the voltage from our mechanism, which will be either an open or short circuit based on the pressure applied. The analog data from the pad is looped and debounced in order to detect when someone is pressing down any of the 4 pads. The randomized mazes were created through the software of the game which utilizes minimum spanning trees to generate randomized mazes with a minimum of 3 spaces in between the users starting point and the designated end point.
