# Software Design
This project was handled by two software programs: Visual Studio 2022 Community Build and Arduino IDE

## Visual Studio 2022
Visual Studio 2022 is an open source IDE that allows utilization of C++/CLI to develop graphics based C++ projects. It was chosen as the optimal coding environment for C++.

## Arduino IDE
Arduino IDE is the coding source for the Arduino Uno board used to fascilitate Analog-to-Digital Conversion for communication between the PCB and computer.
